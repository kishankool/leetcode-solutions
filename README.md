## Introduction

In this repository, you will find solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems. Each problem is categorized and placed in its respective folder, along with a detailed explanation of the problem, the approach I took to solve it, and the code implementation. These solutions are meant to serve as a resource for fellow programmers who are preparing for coding interviews, improving algorithmic skills, or simply exploring new problem-solving techniques.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Problem_Category_1`
  - `Problem_Name_1`
    - `solution.cpp` (e.g., `solution.py`)
  

- `Problem_Category_2`
  - `Problem_Name_2`
    - `solution.cpp`

... (and so on)

## Languages

I provide solutions in multiple programming languages to cater to different preferences and skill levels. Some of the languages you can find solutions in include:


- C++
..

## How to Use

1. Browse through the folders based on problem categories.
2. Within each problem folder, you will find the solution code file (e.g., `solution.cpp`) .
3. The explanation file outlines the problem statement, the approach I used to solve it, and any relevant insights or trade-offs.
4. Feel free to clone this repository and explore the solutions at your own pace. You can also refer to the explanations to understand the thought process behind each solution.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an alternative solution to a problem, a more efficient approach, or if you notice an error in an explanation, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the existing folder structure and include a clear explanation of your changes.
